However, unlike most textbooks and historical mangas, Date Bashira does not focus on the Shogun or famous figures in history. Instead, it brings to light the untold stories of the things surrounding these famous figures. For example, one story tells about the role of how beautiful young men were always accompanying the shoguns into battle. As women were not allowed into a battle zone, the warlords would use these teenage boys to satisfy their sexual urges.\r\n\r\nA different chapter tells the history of the wives of the Shoguns and focuses on the female role in the Sengoku era. As young women were forced into arranged marriages, usually as peace offerings or spies, their husbands usually die in battle at a very early age, as it was the era of war. Date Bashira discusses the idea of remarriage for these women and if they were really in love or were playing the role of a wife.\r\n\r\nDate Bashira takes a different perspective at one of Japan’s most talked about era and even though it is informative, you never get the feeling of a lecture. The beautiful artwork, splash of comedy and the untold, yet interesting historical information really keeps the reader glued onto the pages.

The number of them differ with each diclinous, as does their full range.\r\n\r\nThe tendency for violence among diclonii is high, especially as they grow older. As children, their violence stems from a certain playfullness, unlike the absolute hatred of humans in their later years. Diclonii are rare, as they are the members of their species that are able to reproduce naturally.\r\n\r\nSilpelits are more common. They are the offspring of two humans, the male of which has been infected with the mutation. Interestingly, only males can pass on the genes, and all diclonii and silpelits turn out to be female. Certain scientists noticed an increasing number of babies with horns being born, along with those children murdering their own parents and others, and tried to contain the spreading and find out the cause by placing them in a Facility in cells where they are subject to inhumane experiments to test their abilities or were they await execution for being too dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe main non-mutant character in the story is Kouta, who ends up becoming increasingly involved with one diclonius in particular, the main mutant character Lucy, the only pure diclonius, as she seeks a way to infect or kill all of humanity. Lucy has a cruel and unsettling past, and she has long since lost her empathy for humans, except for Kouta.\r\n\r\nHowever, Director Kakuzawa, who has diclonius ancestry although he doesn't have the vectors, has plans to mate with Lucy and start a true diclonius race. If Lucy is found and he manges to do so, humanity will be nonexistent.\r\n\r\nKouta and Lucy's lives have been intertwined since their childhood, but not necessarily in a good way. And after the virus is airborne and spread across all of Japan, what is the fate of humanity and who holds all of the answers?

But the book's themes (the physical and psychological damage ordinary people suffer from war's realities) ring chillingly true today. Gen and his family have long been struggling without much food, money or medicine, but despite hardships, they try to maintain a semblance of normal life. The adults are exhausted and near despair; the children take air raids and starvation more or less in stride. Nakazawa, a Hiroshima survivor, effectively portrays the strain of living in this environment and shows how efforts to stay upbeat in dire circumstances sometimes manifest as manic, irrational humor. The story offers some optimism: characters perform acts of self-sacrifice for the sake of neighbors and loved ones (e.g., when Gen's pregnant mother becomes ill from malnutrition, he and his brother pose as orphans and perform in the streets, throwing the money over the walls of their home so they won't get caught). Underneath this can-do attitude are the parents' deep guilt and sense of helplessness. When the children clamor ecstatically over a scrap of food, the parents dissolve in shame and grief. The art is sharply drawn and expressive, and the narrative has such a natural rhythm, it's easy to get pulled into the family's life, making the cataclysm readers know awaits them all the more real, intimate and difficult to take. Despite its harrowing nature, this work is invaluable for the lessons it offers in history, humanity and compassion.","cover":"http://s4.mangareader.net/cover/hadashi-no-gen/hadashi-no-gen-l0.jpg"},{"mangaId":"hadi-girl","name":"Hadi Girl","info":"Sae is a very shy high-school girl who, one day, gets visited by a fairy who gives her various \"love challenges\" like \"holding hands\", getting an \"indirect kiss\" or giving a \"lap pillow\".

Not far away from the station, Nanako Okano, a gothic lolita trying to attend a concert, found out that her friends tricked her about the concert ticket because of jealousy.

Based on a well-researched novel by Minoru Watanabe, the series paints a picture not quite as explicit and horrifying as ones in other apocalyptic fiction, but one that is frightening in its detail. \r\n\r\nLike many of Furuya s other works, we are also shown just how fragmented and superficial Japanese youth has become: gals, rock stars, Gothic Lolita s, otaku, salarymen, ganguro, and schoolgirls are all here in their self-imposed stereotypical, shallow glory. But while the ugliness of the fragmentation of Tokyo youth is striking - these people all come together in the face of disaster in a way that is ultimately hopeful. When you strip off the posing and expensive clothing: we are all the same.\r\n\r\nIn the end, 51 Ways is one of Furuya s most optimistic and mainstream works.

For centuries, the male population of Earth has survived by depending on only one woman, called the Holy Mother, whose ova are harvested to create genetically engineered children. By now, any concept of a world in which women exist as ordinary people is long gone. Society has re-structured itself around all-male families, and gay relationships have become the norm.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Marginal, the Holy Mother is assassinated by a terrorist known as Grinja. The government in power doesn't want to start a mass panic, so it pretends that the Holy Mother has only shed her vessel, and that she will be miraculously &quot;reborn&quot; in the near future. The public, which is superstitious and devout, believes this easily. Only government officials know that behind the scenes, there is a frantic effort to create a new being with an XXY chromosome -- a male capable of giving birth. (This is a BL misrepresentation of an actual phenomenon known as Klinefelter's Syndrome.)\r\n\r\nThe manga's story revolves around one such boy -- Kira, the product of a genetic experiment, who becomes involved in a three-way relationship with Grinja, the aforementioned terrorist, and Ashijin, a young man who calls himself Kira's owner.

Witness the titular Punpun (pronounced \\\\\\&quot;poon-poon\\\\\\&quot;), who is depicted as a tiny, caricatured bird in an otherwise normal human setting. The extreme depictions of his overactive imagination are matched at each step by even more bizarre characters.\r\n\r\nAsano keeps a careful balance of exaggeration and realism in both theme and presentation; imagine a stage performance of Looney Tunes.

The profession of private detective fell out of favor long ago, and yet, that's how the young man, Shinjurou Yuuki identifies himself. With his superior deductive powers, Shinjurou solves various challenging cases. Meanwhile, Inga, an attractive young lad, serves as Shinjurou's \"buddy\". But contrary to his cute looks, he's a sharp, arrogant rogue. Why Inga sticks with Shinjurou is as yet unknown. The setting of the story is a postwar, future Tokyo that still bears the scars of war. Ruling the land is Media King Rinroku Kaishou, who through politics and industry has the communications infrastructure under his thumb. Kaishou has used a clear head and the massive amount of information at his fingertips to lead to the solution of a great number of cases. But there's an underside to Kaishou's brilliant deduction work, which is that Shinjurou Yuuki, \"the Last Great Detective\", is the one who actually uncovered \"the truth\" in those cases. However, the public doesn't know this and thus refers to Shinjurou as the \"Defeated Detective\". Still, Shinjurou, together with Inga, can't help but search for the truth.\r\n(Source: Crunchyroll)","cover":"http://s3.mangareader.net/cover/un-go-ingaron/un-go-ingaron-l0.jpg"},{"mangaId":"unbalance-school-life","name":"Unbalance School Life","info":"A former boys' school recently integrated into a co-ed high school.

Haruno is surprised to find out that Sotomura isn't a delinquent at all and is, in fact, just a very socially awkward girl that's bad with words and wants to make friends. She enjoys cooking, handicrafts, and hitting the supermarket sales. She also loves cute and fancy things, but she tries to hide that fact because she feels they don't suit her looks. Haruno's first step in helping Sotomura is to try to teach her how to smile, because whenever she tries, it ends up as a scary grin.
